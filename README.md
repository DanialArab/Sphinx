# Sphinx

https://sphinx-themes.org/

Some notes from https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html:
+ Let’s assume you’ve run sphinx-quickstart. It created a source directory with conf.py and a root document, index.rst. The main function of the root document is to serve as a welcome page, and to contain the root of the “table of contents tree” (or toctree). This is one of the main things that Sphinx adds to reStructuredText, a way to connect multiple files to a single hierarchy of documents.
